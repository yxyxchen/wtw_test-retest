QL2reset_FL2_HM simpleWarning: There were 125 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.99 may help. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup

QL2reset_FL2_HM simpleWarning: There were 66 transitions after warmup that exceeded the maximum treedepth. Increase max_treedepth above 11. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#maximum-treedepth-exceeded

QL2reset_FL2_HM simpleWarning: There were 4 chains where the estimated Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information was low. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bfmi-low

QL2reset_FL2_HM simpleWarning: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems


QL2reset_FL2_HM simpleWarning: The largest R-hat is 4.23, indicating chains have not mixed.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#r-hat

QL2reset_FL2_HM simpleWarning: Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bulk-ess

QL2reset_FL2_HM simpleWarning: Tail Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior variances and tail quantiles may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#tail-ess
